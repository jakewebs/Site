            This project was done in my Data Structures & Algorithms class to apply our work
            surrounding Queues and interfaces to create a sound synthesizer package. The first
            major component was creating a BoundedQueue, which worked to add items to the end
            up to a certain capacity and remove them from the front. Importantly, this Queue was
            also a ring buffer, allowing for a more efficient runtime.
        </p>

        <p>
            With this data structure created, we implemented the Karplus-Strong algorithm, which
            took the integers in the queue and figured out what the audio input would be by
            considering the next value along with energy decay. Then, using the StdAudio package from
            the Princeton javalib, we were able to make an audio output. This structure allows for
            long sequences, such as songs, to be played with a "plucking" sound much like a real guitar.

        <ul>
            <li>
                Implemented a ring-buffer Queue that allowed inputs to be inserted and removed
                in proper form.
            </li>
            <li>
                Used a variation of the Karplus-Strong algorithm to turn those integers into consistent
                audio outputs.
            </li>
            <li>
                Created a digital "keyboard" of strings that could be translated into integer outputs
                for the Queue.

            Because this was a class project, I am not allowed to make this code publicly
            accessible. However, I have been given permission to privately share it with interested
            parties outside of my university, so do contact me if you are curious. (make sure
            this is accurate)
