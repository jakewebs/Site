            This project was done in my Data Structures & Algorithms class to apply our work
            surrounding graphs and KdTrees. Specifically, we were given many vertices in the form
            of locations within the city of Berkeley and sought to use the A* algorithm to find the
            shortest path between two locations. This would be helpful in allowing people to use it
            as a pathfinder for applications like driving and biking to get to their destination
            as quickly as possible.
        </p>

        <p>
            In order to find the shortest path, some form of distance calculation would be necessary.
            I used a KdTree for this, with latitude and longitude as the two dimensions that were considered.
            To make this distance calculation more efficient, I used a pruning algorithm that essentially
            eliminated branches of the tree whose children would have no chance of containing the nearest
            point to the one inputted.

        <ul>
            <li>
                Implemented an efficient A* algorithm to find the shortest path between two
                points in the City of Berkeley.
            </li>
            <li>
                Used a KdTree to make nearestPoint calculations in logarithmic time.
            </li>
            <li>
                Wrote a rastering algorithm that allows users to zoom in and out and have the
                appropriate images displayed.

            Because this was a class project, I am not allowed to make this code publicly
            accessible. However, I have been given permission to privately share it with interested
            parties outside of my university, so do contact me if you are curious. (make sure
            this is accurate)
