# Site
Code for my personal website which is a work in progress!

Components of this repo:

## Images
This folder contains some images that are used on the site.

## Resources
This folder contains some resources (code snippets, tutorials, etc.) that I used to jog my memory/reference. As I believe it is good practices to cite your sources I left these here.

## Info.html
This file contains the HTML code for the site- aka the text along with id/class distinctions and some basic formatting.

## style.css
This file contains the CSS styling used to make **Info.html** appear more aesthetically pleasing.
