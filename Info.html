        <p>
            Hi, my name is Jake Webster and I am a sophomore at the University of California, Berkeley.
            I have lived in the Bay Area my entire life, and currently reside in Los Altos. I am interested
            in majoring in Computer Science along with Economics. Though my primary career focus is more
            oriented towards Software Engineering, finding something that could allow me to work with both
            disciplines would also be very fulfilling!
        </p>
