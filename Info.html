        <p>
            Hi, my name is Jake Webster and I am a sophomore at the University of California, Berkeley.
            I have lived in the Bay Area my entire life, and currently reside in Los Altos. I am interested
            in majoring in Computer Science along with Economics. Though my primary career focus is more
            oriented towards Software Engineering, finding something that could allow me to work with both
            disciplines would also be very fulfilling!
        </p>

        </h2>
        <h4>World Generation</h4>
        <img src="images/byow.jpg" alt="Visual of the map with paths toggled"/>
        <p><em>Java</em> Players attempt to avoid pathfinding enemies in a pseudorandomly generating world.</p>

        <h4>Bearmaps</h4>
        <img src="images/maps.jpg" alt="The map over the Cal campus"/>
        <p><em>Java</em> Users interact with a dynamic map of the city of Berkeley and find the shortest path
            between point A and point B.</p>

        <h4>Ants</h4>
        <img src="images/ants.jpg" alt="The Bee swarm threatens the Ants"/>
        <p><em>Python</em> In a parody of hit mobile game <em>Plants Vs. Zombies</em>, players attempt to
            prevent the Bees from reaching the Ant Queen with a number of tactical Ants.</p>

        <h4>Digital Guitar</h4>
        <img src="images/guitar.jpg" alt="A messy string that outputs an elegant song"/>
        <p><em>Java</em> Users can enter a sequence of characters and get a nice melody outputted using
            the Karplus-Strong algorithm to convert the String to "plucking".</p>

        <h4>Stock Predictor</h4>
        <img src="images/stocks.jpg" alt="A snippet of code from the project"/>
        <p><em>Python</em> This was a group project to see whether a neural network trained on day-to-day
            fluctuations and medium-term data such as financial reports could outperform the market.</p>
