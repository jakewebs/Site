            The idea of training a computer algorithm to assist in appraising stock prices
            is hardly new, and is what I attempted along with two others this summer. Specifically,
            we used Support Vector Machines as our classifier to distinguish between poor performers and
            strong performers. We sought to mix short-term data (such as momentum and volatitly in stock
            prices), with medium-to-long-term data about the company (such as info and trends from 10-Q
            and 10-K reports).
        </p>

        <p>
            Ultimately, we did see some success with the network, outperforming the Efficient Market
            Hypothesis (which would expect movement to be somewhat random, or 50/50 accuracy), but not
            by a statistically significant margin. Nonetheless, this provided an interesting synthesis
            of business and technical knowledge and taught me a good amount about web-scraping and how
            machine learning works.

            The overall project repository is currently private, though I am generally open to
            discussing my work more in detail. If we make this code, I will link it here.
